# Zorg-styled text based Pokemon adventure game
This project is a zorg-styled text-based adventure game. The game runs on Python terminal and doesnt need any additional installments or plugins.
The game loosely follows the structure of the original Pokemon story and allows you to explore, solve puzzles, catch Pokemon and gather a party strong enough to beat the Gym Leader Brock in Pewter City and earn the Boulderbadge.

## How do you play?
The game is played entirely trough the terminal. You need get creative and write actions based on the queues the environment and NPC's offer. The actions you write change the game state and allow you to progress.
Heres a brief summary of how you play the game:
